CMake Refuckulator
==================

Do you find CMake to be completely fucked in the head?

### CMake is totally fucked in the head

1. It is impossible to read what the fuck is going on
1. The CMakeLists.txt.cache.whatever bullshit makes it impossible to fix someone else's broken fucking setup
1. I'm trying to quit smoking, because I'm trying to set a good example for my daughter or whatever, but she still smokes, and anyways CMake is completely fucked in the head.

### Refuckulate your CMake projects

The CMake Refuckulator will fix your CMake-based project so that it isn't totally fucked in the head by changing the build system to GNU Autotools. Simply copy the `refuckulate.rb` script into the top level directory of any completely fucked CMake project and run it, and it will walk you through the process of fixing your setup so that it's less of a complete pain in the ass.
